  <h2>Want to learn some korean?</h2>
  <p>The korean alphabet looks a lot different than ours but it's actually very similar in the way that we read and write and form words. They use vowels and consonants like us to form words and syllables! Here's the alphabet:</p>

  <p>To pronounce and read BTS' korean name, we need to start off with how it's written in korean!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>방탄소년단</h3>
  <h3>bang-tan-so-nyeon-dan</h3>
  <p>You can see with each consonant and vowel, you read from left to right</p>
